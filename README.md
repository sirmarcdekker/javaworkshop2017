# java workshop 2017
Java 8 workshop

The purpose of this workshop is to help developers who have a basic understanding of java to learn java 8 concepts in a
hands on process.

We hope to help both beginners and more experienced java 8 developers with something new to learn. This is why we have
divided each feature in multiple levels. These levels are Basic, Advanced and Challenges.
The Basic level addresses the most basic topics of a feature such as construction and simple manipulation. We also try
to make sure that we keep the topic isolated if at all possible so that each topic can be picked up without the need
to have done the other modules. If this is not the case this will be noted in the comments at the start of the class as
explained below.
The Advanced level goes more in depth into possibilities of features especially when they touch upon/use the other
 Java 8 features such as lambda's. We will note in the comments at the start of the file what other features are
 touched upon in the class and we advice that if you have no experience with these subjects that you do the basic lesson
 of those features so you have no problem during with the exercises.
The Challenges level are the most complex and are intended to let you try your hand at more complex problems which
uses the knowledge gained from earlier exercises and might also more heavily require knowledge of other features.

During this workshop we will be discussing various topics that have been added or significantly changed with the
introduction of java 8. The features are Optionals, Streams, Java Time, Lambda's, concurrency and the New IO API. While
the repo is set up so you can do study the features in any order you want we want to advice people completely new to
Java 8 to go through the following features in the noted order: Optional -> Lambda -> Stream. this is because the
Stream basics topic actually will be using concepts of the other two features.

The excersizes are set up in a uniform way. Each file is named after the feature it covers and the level it is for. In
the comments at the start of the file we will explain which topics will be covered in the file and which other java 8
 features will be covered during in the class. Each excersize class will contain one or more excersizes in the form of
 methods. Above the method will be a piece of java doc explaining what needs to be done for the excersize and which test
 file will check the results of the test. These test files contain one or more JUnit tests that will check if the
 function has been implemented correctly. We are aware that a lot of excerzises can be done without using Java 8
 features but doing that would offcourse defeat the point of the excerzise.
